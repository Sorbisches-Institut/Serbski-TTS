# Example: Web Integration of Serbski TTS

## Overview

The script depends on:

- **Bootstrap**  
- **jQuery**  
- **jQuery UI**  
- **FontAwesome**  

It was originally used within a **custom WordPress setup**. This example is provided as a **reference** and may require adjustments for other websites.

## Files

2. Click **Start Reading** to test the TTS player.  
3. Adjust container IDs or library inclusion if integrating into another website.
