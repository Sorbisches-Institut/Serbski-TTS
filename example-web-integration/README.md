# Example: Web Integration of Serbski TTS

This directory contains a **working example** of how to integrate the Serbski TTS JavaScript into a website.

## Overview

The JavaScript demonstrates a working TTS integration as used on **www.serbski-institut.de**, where the player and TTS functionality in **Lower and Upper Sorbian** can be tested.

The script depends on:

- **Bootstrap**  
- **jQuery**  
- **jQuery UI**  
- **FontAwesome**  

It was originally used within a **custom WordPress setup**. This example is provided as a **reference** and may require adjustments for other websites.
